# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition

The network depth, which is the number of stacked layers, is a common problem in Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
because if the depth increases, the accuracy gets saturated (degradation problem). So, this paper addresses this problem by
introducing a deep residual learning framework.
